Problem
-------
Coin Change (minimum coins) â€” dynamic programming.

Given an array of distinct positive integers `coins` representing coin
denominations and an integer `amount`, return the fewest number of coins
that you need to make up that amount. If the amount cannot be made up by any
combination of the coins, return -1.

Example:
Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
Output: 3  # 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

Complexity (typical DP): O(n * amount) time, O(amount) extra space
